# Indian-rooftops-detection

This work is a part of the Savera.ai’s instant rooftop mapping for the solar panel installation project. India’s satellite map resolution is very low which makes rooftops’ detection harder. It includes detection of rooftops from the low-resolution satellite view of Google Maps, Image Segmentation using deep neural network based on U-Net architecture, TensorFlow, and Python 3.5. The dataset used in this project belongs to the Savera.ai team.
